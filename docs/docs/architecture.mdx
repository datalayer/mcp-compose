# Architecture

MCP Compose is a Python facade for multiple managed MCP servers. It aggregates tools, prompts, and resources into a single unified MCP server and exposes that aggregation through REST and Web UI.

## Managed MCP servers

A managed server can be:

- Embedded: a Python package implementing an MCP server (loaded in-process)
- Proxied: an external MCP server connected via STDIO, Streamable HTTP, or SSE (deprecated)

## Component overview

    MCP Compose (Facade)
    ├─ Authn/Authz middleware
    ├─ Transport layer (STDIO / Streamable HTTP / SSE)
    ├─ Tool manager
    ├─ Process manager
    └─ REST API + Web UI
         └─ Managed MCP servers

## Configuration

All configuration is provided in mcp_compose.toml.

    [composer]
    name = "my-unified-server"
    conflict_resolution = "prefix"

    [[servers]]
    name = "filesystem"
    command = "python"
    args = ["-m", "mcp_server_filesystem", "/data"]
    transport = "stdio"

## Security

Authentication and authorization are pluggable. Use bearer tokens or OAuth2/OIDC validation when deploying in production.
