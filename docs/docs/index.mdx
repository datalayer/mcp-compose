# MCP Compose

MCP Compose is a unified control plane for multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It exposes a single MCP endpoint, a REST API, and a modern Web UI for orchestration, monitoring, and tool invocation.

## What you can do with MCP Compose

- **Compose multiple MCP servers** into one unified interface
- **Discover and invoke tools** across servers with conflict resolution
- **Manage server lifecycles** (start/stop/restart) from UI, CLI, or API
- **Translate protocols** between STDIO and Streamable HTTP (SSE deprecated)
- **Observe in real time** with metrics, logs, and health checks

## Quick start

Create a minimal configuration file:

```toml
[composer]
name = "my-composer"
conflict_resolution = "prefix"

[[servers]]
name = "filesystem"
command = "python"
args = ["-m", "mcp_server_filesystem", "/data"]
transport = "stdio"

[[servers]]
name = "calculator"
command = "python"
args = ["-m", "mcp_server_calculator"]
transport = "stdio"
```

Start the server:

```bash
mcp-compose serve --config mcp_compose.toml
```

Open the Web UI at **http://localhost:8000** and the REST API at **http://localhost:8000/api/v1**.
