# MCP Compose

MCP Compose is a unified control plane for multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It exposes a single MCP endpoint, a REST API, and a modern Web UI for orchestration, monitoring, and tool invocation.

## What you can do with MCP Compose

- **Compose multiple MCP servers** into one unified interface
- **Discover and invoke tools** across servers with conflict resolution
- **Manage server lifecycles** (start/stop/restart) from UI, CLI, or API
- **Translate protocols** between STDIO and Streamable HTTP (SSE deprecated)
- **Observe in real time** with metrics, logs, and health checks

## Get Started
